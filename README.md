## What is inside

## System requirements

Required OS is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64-bit or its flavours that can install ROS Melodic.
Suggested variant of OS installation is dual boot instead of virtualization that can be slow and can not handle well the simulation GUI.

## Installing uav_core

The prefered way is to install the whole [mrs_uav_system](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_system).
However, if you prefer to install only the *uav_core*, you can do the following:

1. Clone the repository,
2. place it into your *catkin workspace*,
3. call ```installation/install.sh```,
4. build the the workspace.

## Finishing your .bashrc
